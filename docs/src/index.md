# Overview    {#mathfu_overview}

[MathFu][] is a C++ math library developed primarily for games focused on
simplicity and efficiency.

It provides a suite of [vector][], [matrix][] and [quaternion][] classes
to perform basic [geometry][] suitable for game developers.  This functionality
can be used to construct geometry for graphics libraries like [OpenGL][] or
perform calculations for animation or physics systems.

[MathFu] can be downloaded from [GitHub](http://github.com/google/mathfu) or
the [releases page](http://github.com/google/mathfu/releases).

**Important**: MathFu uses submodules to reference other components it depends
upon so download the source using:

~~~{.sh}
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/mathfu.git
~~~

# Functionality

Each [vector][], [matrix][] and [quaternion][] class implements basic
arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in
addition to simple [linear algebra][] operators (e.g dot product,
cross product, inverse, slerp).

# Optimization

[MathFu][] is optimized using [SIMD][] instructions (including [NEON][] for
[ARM][] and [SSE][] for [x86][] architectures).  [SIMD][] optimization is
enabled by default based upon the target platform and compiler options used
to build a project.  In addition, [MathFu][] provides compile time options to
modify code generation, see [Build Configurations][] for more details.

# Supported Platforms

[MathFu][] has been tested on the following platforms:

   * [Android][]
   * [Linux][] (x86_64)
   * [OS X][]
   * [Windows][]

This library is entirely written in C++ with the exception of some
conditionally enabled compiler intrinsics and some workarounds for different
compiler quirks, which means that it *should* work with either no or little
modification on any platform that has a C++ compiler.

# Feedback and Reporting Bugs
